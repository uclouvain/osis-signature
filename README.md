# OSIS Signature

`OSIS Signature` is a Django application to ease signature workflows OSIS plateform.

# Requirements

`OSIS Signature` requires

- Django 2.2+

# Installation

## Configuring Django

Add `osis_signature` to `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'osis_signature',
    ...
)
```

Add `osis_signature` urls to your patterns (useful for autocompletion):

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    path('osis_signature/', include('osis_signature.urls')),
]
```

# Using OSIS Signature

`osis_signature` is used to manage signature states for a workflow implementing approval.

## Attach to a model

Attach a process by declaring a `SignatureProcessField` to enable adding actors for signing.

```python
from django.db import models
from osis_signature.contrib.fields import SignatureProcessField


class YourModel(models.Model):
    ...
    jury = SignatureProcessField()
```

## Exposing actors in a form

To add or edit actors of your model, you can use the `ActorFormsetMixin` mixin which adds a formset to your view.

As a reminder, you can configure the formset as per
[formset documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/forms/modelforms/#model-formsets), override the
`actors_formset_factory_kwargs` attribute to set the factory kwargs, for example:

- force having at least a number of actors with the `min_num` option (default: 1)
- restrict adding too many actors with the `max_num` and `validate_max` options
- override `form` (defaults to `ActorForm`) to
    - handle more precisely field widgets
    - only allow adding external actors using `ExternalActorForm`
    - only allow adding internal actors using `InternalActorForm`

## Attaching extra data to actors

If you need extra data attached to actors, subclass the model, and use it in the mixin, e.g.:

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

from osis_signature.models import Actor
from osis_signature.contrib.fields import SignatureProcessField


class YourModel(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    jury = SignatureProcessField()


class SpecialActor(Actor):
    civility = models.CharField(
        max_length=30,
        choices=(
            ('mr', 'M.'),
            ('mme', 'Mme'),
        )
    )

    external_fields = ['civility'] + Actor.external_fields


# forms.py
from osis_signature.contrib.forms import ActorForm
from osis_signature.models import Actor


class SpecialActorForm(ActorForm):
    class Meta(ActorForm.Meta):
        model = SpecialActor
        fields = ['civility'] + Actor.widget_fields


# views.py
from osis_signature.contrib.mixins import ActorFormsetMixin
from django.views import generic


class SimpleCreateView(ActorFormsetMixin, generic.CreateView):
    model = YourModel
    fields = '__all__'
    actors_formset_factory_kwargs = {
        'model': SpecialActor,
        'form': SpecialActorForm,
    }
```

## Display actors

When displaying a process' value, you can use the following template tag:

```html
{% load osis_signature %}

{% signature_table instance.jury %}
```

This will display a bootstrap-themed table of actors with their corresponding state for the process, and the button to
send an e-mail and or sign by PDF. You can pass `allow_pdf=False` or `allow_sending=False` to prevent showing these
buttons.

If you need more granular control over the rendering of this table, the output is similar to:

```html
{% load i18n %}
<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>#</th>
    <th>{% trans "First name" %}</th>
    <th>{% trans "Last name" %}</th>
    <th>{% trans "E-mail" %}</th>
    <th>{% trans "Status" %}</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  {% for actor in actors %}
  <tr>
    <th scope="row">{{ forloop.counter }}</th>
    <td>{{ actor.computed.first_name }}</td>
    <td>{{ actor.computed.last_name }}</td>
    <td>{{ actor.computed.email }}</td>
    <td>{{ actor.get_state_display }}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
  </tbody>
</table>
```

## Implement the signing workflow

To fully implement a signing workflow, you will need to implement these views:

1. a _send invite_ view (requiring at least an actor to send the invite to as a parameter)
1. a _signing_ view (requiring at least a token to identify the signing actor as a parameter)

Here's an example url configuration:

```python
from django.urls import path
from yourapp import views

app_name = 'yourapp'
urlpatterns = [
    path('send-invite/<int:pk>', views.SendInviteView.as_view(), name="send-invite"),
    path('sign/<path:token>', views.SigningView.as_view(), name="sign"),
]
```

You can of course add as much as parameters as needed to give more context to your views.

### Send an invitation

To send an e-mail when the user clicks on a _"Send invitation"_ button, you must implement a view. It is advised to use
other modules such as
[osis-mail-template](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-mail-template),
[osis-notification](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-notification) and
[osis-history](https://github.com/uclouvain/osis-history):

```python
from django.forms import Form
from django.shortcuts import redirect, resolve_url
from django.views import generic
from django.views.generic.detail import SingleObjectMixin
from osis_history.utilities import add_history_entry
from osis_signature.utils import get_signing_token
from osis_mail_template import generate_email
from osis_notification.contrib.handlers import EmailNotificationHandler
from osis_signature.models import Actor, SignatureState
from yourapp.mail_templates import YOUR_TEMPLATE_MAIL_ID


class SendInviteView(SingleObjectMixin, generic.FormView):
    form_class = Form
    model = Actor
    template_name = "send_invite.html"

    def dispatch(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        self.object = self.get_object()
        return super().dispatch(request, *args, **kwargs)

    def form_valid(self, form):
        actor = self.object
        actor.switch_state(SignatureState.INVITED)
        tokens = {
            "first_name": actor.computed.first_name,
            "last_name": actor.computed.last_name,
            "signing_link": resolve_url('yourapp:sign', token=get_signing_token(actor)),
        }
        email_message = generate_email(
            YOUR_TEMPLATE_MAIL_ID,
            actor.computed.language,
            tokens,
            recipients=[actor.computed.email],
        )
        EmailNotificationHandler.create(email_message)
        add_history_entry(
            actor.process_id,
            '{} notifi√© par e-mail'.format(actor.computed.email),
            '{} notified by mail'.format(actor.computed.email),
            self.request.user.person.username,
        )
        return redirect('home')
```

### Implement signing view

To implement the logic behind a "Sign uploading PDF" button, or an actor clicking on a signing link in a received
e-mail. You must implement a view and may use either `CommentSigningForm` or `PdfSigningForm` :

```python

from django.http import Http404
from django.urls import reverse_lazy
from django.views import generic

from osis_signature.contrib.forms import CommentSigningForm
from osis_signature.models import Actor
from osis_signature.utils import get_actor_from_token


class SigningView(generic.UpdateView):
    form_class = CommentSigningForm
    model = Actor
    template_name = "sign.html"
    success_url = reverse_lazy('home')

    def get_object(self, queryset=None):
        actor = get_actor_from_token(self.kwargs['token'])
        if not actor:
            raise Http404
        return actor
```

And for the template `sign.html`:

```html
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% load i18n bootstrap3 %}

{% block content %}
<div class="page-header">
  <h1>{% blocktrans %}Sign for {{ related_object }}{% endblocktrans %}</h1>
</div>

<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  {% crsf_token %}
  {% if form.pdf_file %}
  {% blocktrans %}
    Upload the PDF document on behalf of {{ actor.computed.first_name }} {{ actor.computed.last_name }}.
    {% endblocktrans %}
    {% bootstrap_form form %}
    <button type="submit" name="submitted" value="approved" class="btn btn-primary">
      {% trans "Upload" %}
    </button>
  {% else %}
    {% blocktrans %}
    Hello {{ actor.computed.first_name }} {{ actor.computed.last_name }}, indicate here if you
    approve or decline.
    {% endblocktrans %}
    {% bootstrap_form form %}
    <button type="submit" name="submitted" value="approved" class="btn btn-primary">Approve</button>
    <button type="submit" name="submitted" value="declined" class="btn btn-danger">Decline</button>
  {% endif %}
</form>
{% endblock %}
```

NB: it is very important to provide two buttons with the `submitted` name, so that the system know if the signature is
approved or declined.

You may notice that this template can be used both for signing by PDF (on behalf of an actor) or as result of clicking
an e-mail link.

## Checking if all actors have signed

You may check within a queryset if all actors have signed by using the `all_signed` lookup or by checking the manager
method on the field:

```python
from yourapp.models import YourModel

YourModel.objects.filter(jury__all_signed=True)
assert YourModel.objects.first().jury.all_signed()
```
